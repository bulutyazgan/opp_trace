        "summary": "Sreedath Panat\n        \n              \n          I recently implemented an intelligent surveillance system that uses YOLOv8 with pose estimation added on top of it. It was so much fun.\n\nHere is how I built it:\n\nThe architecture:\nStep 1: YOLOv8 nano [pretrained] for person detection\nI started with YOLOv8 nano as my backbone - it is incredibly lightweight but maintains good accuracy for person detection. The model runs at over 30 FPS on standard hardware, making it ideal for real-time applications. YOLOv8's improved anchor-free design gives cleaner bounding boxes, which is crucial for the next step.\n\nStep 2: Pose estimation layer\nFor each person detected by YOLO, I integrated a pose estimation model that extracts 17 key skeletal points. This runs only on the cropped person regions from YOLO's bounding boxes, making it computationally efficient.\n\nStep 3: Behavioral analysis engine\nThis is where I embedded a hand-engineered logic.\n-> Angle calculations between joints to detect aggressive stances\n-> Velocity tracking of key points to identify sudden movements\n-> Static pose analysis for loitering detection\n-> Ground-level pose patterns that might indicate someone concealing items\n\nUsed YOLOv8 nano specifically for its speed-accuracy trade-off\nImplemented a sliding window approach for temporal analysis\nAdded confidence thresholds to reduce false positives\nCreated custom alert triggers based on pose pattern combinations\n\nThe model is still not perfect. Crouching is often detected as lying down. But I guess it is not too difficult to make it better. I just wanted to share version 1 here.\n\nMy algorithm successfully flags unusual behaviors while maintaining low false positive rates. It can distinguish between normal activities like bending to pick something up versus suspicious crouching patterns.\n\nThe combination of YOLOv8's detection with pose-based analysis is a great system. Last week, two founders messaged me that they are using a system similar to this in their physical security product pipeline. So cool!\n\nI am taking a series of 2 lectures (3 hours+) on YOLO this week and next. If you are interested, you can register here for free as part of Vizuara Hands-on Computer Vision Bootcamp.

Unlike monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, or previous multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization, the MVTracker feed-forward model directly predicts 3D correspondences using a practical number of cameras, in this case 4, enabling robust and accurate online tracking.\n\n\nGiven multi-view RGB videos and camera parameters the method first extracts per-view feature maps using a CNN encoder. A fused 3D point cloud is the constructed from estimated or sensor-provided depth, associating each point with learned features. Directed kNN-based correlation links points across space and time, capturing spatiotemporal relationships across views. A transformer iteratively refines point trajectories using attention over multi-view correlations. The model processes sequences in overlapping sliding windows, producing temporally consistent 3D point trajectories with occlusion-aware visibility predictions.\n\n👉 Check out the paper, examples and code here: https://lnkd.in/dB-adJwy",

The aim of the package is to explore unknown environments to build your maps. Rafał Górecki from Husarion has written a pretty good tutorial to setup and use explore_lite on your ROS 2 Robots with Nav2 and slam_toolbox.\n\nUsing the explore_lite package, your robot can:\n ✅ Automatically pick unexplored frontiers on a map\n ✅ Navigate towards them using Nav2\n ✅ Expand its knowledge with slam_toolbox\n ✅ Repeat until the whole area is discovered\n\nThis complete the cycle from SLAM → Path Planning → Exploration, showing how a ROSbot (or its Gazebo simulation) can explore and map an environment with minimal human input. It’s a great example of how ROS 2 tools come together to turn theory into practice.\n\n🔗 Check the tutorial and add explore_lite in your autonomous toolkit!\n\nWhich ROS 2 packages are you using for autonomous exploration?\n\nLet's connect and share robotics tips 🔽 \n#Robotics #ROS2 #SLAM",

Then, you can create separate modules that use VTK in the backend and Vue.js in the frontend, and integrate them all into a Trame application.\n\nThe idea behind plugins is that you can build multiple modules and simply plug or unplug them based on client requirements. This also makes it easy to create custom plugins for a specific client without touching the core app or other plugins.\n\nAll you need are the connections to the core app; meaning how to receive inputs and send outputs. And your plugin will fit seamlessly into the viewer without interfering with the other plugins.\n\nThis isn’t a new concept; in fact, it’s the same idea used in 3D Slicer, where they call them extensions. Whenever you want to create a new extension in 3D Slicer, there’s a specific template you need to follow, which ensures your module integrates smoothly and interacts with all base modules without requiring changes to the main viewer.\n\nI wanted to share this tip with you. You might find it helpful when building your own DICOM viewer. And if you ever need help, you can always reach out to the PYCAD team.",

Detecting and predicting slips in real-time is critical for achieving reliable, human-like dexterity, yet existing approaches often struggle in the presence of imbalanced data and complex tactile signals.\n\nOur approach: We evaluated tactile data representations from 1D to 4D with CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers. Models that learned the spatial and temporal structure of taxels delivered the strongest results, and our new SMOTE-CNN reduced dataset imbalance to boost slip detection accuracy.\n\nKey Results:\n📊 +3% F1-score improvement over baselines\n🛡️ 95% reduction in false negatives (crucial for avoiding dropped objects)\n🤖 Real-time slip avoidance with Model Predictive Control (MPC)\n📂 Open-source tactile dataset for benchmarking future research\n\nWhy It Matters: Robots that can reliably sense, predict, and prevent slips will be far more capable in real-world environments—from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and assistive robotics.\n\nA huge thank you to:\n🙏 Prof. Amir Ghalamzan for giving me the chance and resources to apply my skills in ML and sensing systems at the Intelligent Manipulation Lab (Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (L-CAS)), University of Lincoln.\n🙏 Mojtaba Esfandiari for his thorough and compassionate feedback.\n🙏 Kiyanoush Nazari for his patient mentorship. Kiyanoush taught me the ropes of research, from how to read daunting papers and present research rigorously to facing reviewer criticism with courage. His words, “If your research took a huge effort to produce, then your presentation must take twice as much,” live rent-free in my soul.\n\n📄 Read our paper here: https://lnkd.in/d9c6Sfd5\n\nThis is one step closer to building robots with the dexterity and adaptability needed for the next generation of intelligent manipulation.
